## Windows Installation

### 1. Install Python
- Download Python 3.8 or newer from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

#### Add Tesseract to your PATH (Automated):
- Run the provided `add_tesseract_to_path.bat` script as administrator (right-click â†’ "Run as administrator").
- If you installed Tesseract in a different location, edit the script and change the path at the top.
- You may need to restart your terminal or computer for the change to take effect.

 ... or ...

#### Add Tesseract to your PATH (Manual):
- Open the Start menu, search for "Environment Variables", and open "Edit the system environment variables".
- Click "Environment Variables..."
- Under "System variables", find and select the `Path` variable, then click "Edit..."
- Click "New" and add the path to your Tesseract install folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`)
- Click OK to close all dialogs.

### 3. Install Git (optional, but recommended)
- Download Git for Windows from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install it.

### 4. Download DoTranslate
#### Option 1: Using Git
```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DoTranslate.git
cd DoTranslate
```
#### Option 2: Download ZIP
- Go to your GitHub repo page.
- Click the green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP".
- Extract the ZIP file and open the extracted folder.

### 5. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 6. Install Python Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 7. Run the App
```sh
python translator.py
```

### 8. (Optional) Build a Standalone Executable
If you want a Windows `.exe`:
```sh
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed translator.py
```
The `.exe` will appear in the `dist` folder.

#### Tesseract Language Packs
By default, Tesseract on Windows comes with English. For other languages (Chinese, Russian, etc.), download the `.traineddata` files from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata) and place them in your `tessdata` folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tessdata`).

#### Troubleshooting
- **The LibreNode API can only process a limited number of characters at a time (typically three or four paragraphs), so if you encounter an error, simply reduce the number of lines in the text field to be translated.**
- If you get an error about Tesseract not found, double-check your PATH and that Tesseract is installed.
- If you get a missing DLL error, make sure you installed the correct (64-bit or 32-bit) version of Python and Tesseract for your system.
