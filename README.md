## Installation

### 1. Build and Install the Standalone Executable (Recommended)
This is the easiest and most user-friendly way to install dotranslate. It will build the app, install it to `/opt/translator`, and add it to your applications menu.

```bash
sudo ./install_and_build.sh
```

After installation, you can launch dotranslate from your applications menu or by running:
```bash
/opt/translator/translator
```

### 2. (Optional) Run with Python (No Build)
If you prefer to run the app directly with Python (for development or troubleshooting):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theresepot/dotranslate.git
cd dotranslate
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python translator.py
```
